Hopefully this works, this is the Ubuntu Version test
With Python 3.8.x



Sad didnt work

sometimes try try try agian bc python is weird

no glitter

Trying again with subprocess command


it doesnt like regex for some reason.. dont know why


you cant see me typing on my other screen testing if pip (version) is out of date



probably not going to work but i have high hopes



yup




trying to run as sudo(root)


now i see the problem.... pip isnt installed by default on ubuntu... werid have to install it,


good check, sometimes it doesnt work all the time



Stupid ubuntu

we will eventually have to check if that command also runs on other debian systems.. we might be screwed on redhat



nvm just had an idea... try except baby

fingers crossed?


now im big sad

Trying to make code self sufficient is very difficult

Testing that command to see if it even works

command worked.. testing autocode

still no go on regex


regex isnt installing unsure why

trying to manually install it
okay.....
no doubt the code should work now thoug... dk why regex is being weird


works fine.. just regex


uninstalled regex maybe sudo was problem? SUDO was problem!!

push complete!
